# Spring Boot + Vue Example
 
This example app shows how to create a Spring Boot API and display its data with Vue.

<!-- Please read [Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and Vue](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/12/06/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-react) to see how this app was created. -->

**Prerequisites:** [Java 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-vue-example.git
cd spring-boot-react-example
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions below.

To run the server, cd into the `server` folder and run:
 
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To run the client, cd into the `client` folder and run:
 
```bash
npm
npm start
```

The primary example (without authentication) is in the `master` branch, while the Okta integration is in the `okta` branch. To check out the Okta branch on your local machine, run the following command.

```bash
git checkout okta
```

### Create an Application in Okta

You will need to create an OpenID Connect Application in Okta to get your values to perform authentication. 

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don’t have an account) and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Single-Page App**, click **Next**, and give the app a name you’ll remember. Change all instances of `localhost:8080` to `localhost:8081` and click **Done**.

#### Server Configuration

Set the `issuer` and copy the `clientId` into `server/src/main/resources/application.yml`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.oktapreview.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

```yml
okta:
  oauth2:
    client-id: {yourClientId}
    issuer: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
```

#### Client Configuration

Set the `issuer` and copy the `clientId` into `client/src/App.tsx`.

```typescript
Vue.use(OktaVuePlugin, {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  client_id: '{yourClientId}',
  ...
});
```
